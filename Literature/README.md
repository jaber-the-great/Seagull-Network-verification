* Skimming the papers (intro, approach) --> If not so related, jsut several bullet points:
 * One is the general approach (MPC, cryptography, SMT, just verification and no privacy)
 * Shortcomings
 * Scale
 * ....
* If it is so relevant, dig through it and share with me
* Have some idea to include in related works
* Find other possible related works

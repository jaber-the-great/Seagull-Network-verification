- [ ] Finishing the iterature review: Extensively looking for the existing papers working on similar problem (network verification is one problem, privacy preserving computation over graph is another problem)
- [ ] Testing the codes and running them on server for benchmarking
- [ ] Review and rewrite the paper through several iterations.
- [ ] Putting the paper on archive 
- [ ] Increamental with TNO
- [ ] Add the report /paper/
- [ ] Runs the code with different setup (scale mamba has this option)
  - [ ] Changing number of parties 
  - [ ] Changing the threshold 
- [ ] Rethink storing and retrieving the shares
- [ ] Rethink getting input from command line
- [ ] Rethink getting the changes from a file
- [x] Starting to use other framework 
- [ ] Running the code for incremental method
- [ ] Proof of privacy:
  - [ ] Data collection
  - [ ] Secret re-sharing
  - [ ] Incremental version
  - [ ] Revealing the result
- [x] Consider import/export policy (So IMPORTANT)
- [ ] Second table for back up link?
